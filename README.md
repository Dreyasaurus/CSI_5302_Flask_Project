# CSI_5302_Flask_Project

TO DO:
1. Install the 2019 MySQL version Links to an external site.of the database. make SQL - **Audrey**
2. Create an analytics table. The table may contain additional analytic fields (recommended) but must contain a result of your own creation called park-adjusted runs created and park-adjusted runs created per 27 outs

Challenge:
1. The Lahman data is missing data about pitchers. In particular, all of the data required for park-adjusted runs created can be found for pitchers but is not in the Lahman database. Retrosheet Links to an external site.is a company which has computerized accounts of all baseball games since 1974 (they are attempting to get all games since 1920). A third-party program called BEVENT Links to an external site.can parse the data for each game. You can then write a program to compile this data into a result suitable for inserting into the database. You are to create a table called PitchingAgainst, which contains all of the fields of the Batting table for all pitchers since 1974 (inclusive). The PitchingAgainst table will have one row for each row in the Pitching table, and we include the results allowed by the pitcher.
2. Create a pitching analytics table. The table may contain additional analytic fields (recommended), but it must contain a result of my own creation called park-adjusted runs created allowed and park-adjusted runs created allowed per 27 outs (see below for details).
